Falling Stars Notes:

I couldn't work out how to link the exe file to the falling-stars file. 
At this point, the falling stars game project folder is just the development stuff.
If I need to fix any bugs or update anything, I can run the game in release and then
drag the files over from the release folder into Falling-Stars and overwrite the old files.
This is not the ideal way I would want to set up the files, but I'll learn eventually how to 
fix it.



This was my first game development project. I'm very pleased with how it came out, 
especially with my poor art skills xD
I want to give a tremendous thanks to lazyfoo for the SDL tutorials, which most of my code 
is based off of. Now it's time for the next project! :)
