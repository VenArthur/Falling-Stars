Falling Stars Notes:

Create Player Class

Y-axis can be const because the player will only move on the X-axis

Need render function

Need handle event function

Score should be handled by the player class

Player will need 6 images, 2 for running left, 2 for running right, and 2 for standing still 
(one looking left, and one looking right)

Will need to make textures for all 6 images, and 1 extra Texture for rendering the current 
texture.

Implement collision with stars

Create astroids
