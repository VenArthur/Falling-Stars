Falling Stars Notes:

Create astroids

Need to work on movement of the meteors with a counter and how the meteors appear

Functions needed from stars (similar to)
move
render
getCollider, meteor collider will be a circle
shiftColliders
checkCollision needs circle and rect parameters
distanceSquared - could probably friend from Stars 
getPosX
getPosY

Will need velocity for both X and Y, or one if they are the same value

Will need a do not render flag 

Meteors will handle the hearts, will need to implement
