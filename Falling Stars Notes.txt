Falling Stars Notes:
For leaderboard:
will be top 10
first value is score, name of player
if the current score is > a score already on the list, 
	pop_back and insert the new score and get name of player

will need to render score list, below game over and above the play button
create a texture to pop up and request the player's name if their score is top 10


score and name is text to screen

when reading the line of a file it is in string.
since the score will be first, loop the string chars until it reaches a - (dash)
push those chars into another string and make it an int to compare to the players score
if the player's score is larger than what was read, then get the player's name
	the string line that was being read, if it now equals 
	players score to string + "-" + players name
	will it write to the file where the line was read???
	
else 
the file line gets pushed into a string array for rendered text
go to the next line


create a prompt for the player's name before the game starts
