Falling Stars Notes:

Fix Player animation - should be short delay between steps 
(like if you were to tap the a <- d or -> buttons)

Fix Player has a short delay before moving

Score should be handled by the player class

Implement collision with stars
 Check collision in the star move function? Will need to pass in player.getCollider()
	If there is collision, do not render flag is set

Create astroids
